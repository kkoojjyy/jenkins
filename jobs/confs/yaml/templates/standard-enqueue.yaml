          unstable-message: >

            It seems that this change attempts to target one or more
            non-existent change queues.

            This could be because support for a version of oVirt that
            this change targets had ended or because a change queue for
            it was not yet created.

            Please remove 'build-artifacts' jobs targeting non-existent
            change queues.
          notbuilt-message: >

            This change was not submitted to any change queues for
            system testing. You will need to create some
            'build-artifacts' jobs if you want changes to be submitted
            to change queues, take part in the system tests and be
            deployed to the nightly snapshot repositories.
